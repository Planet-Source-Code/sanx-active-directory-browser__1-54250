Installation
------------

To make this package work, you will need to modify the common.asp file to reflect the fully-qualified domain name of your Active Directory domain. The line you need to edit is:

strDomainRoot = "DC=yourdomain,DC=yourcountry"

You will also need to run the site with domain administrative permissions or using integrated windows authentication. The web-server must be a member of the domain to be managed, although it does not need to be a domain controller.
